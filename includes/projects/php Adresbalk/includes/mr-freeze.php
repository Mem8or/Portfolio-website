					<p>Mr Freeze first appeared in Batman #121 (February, 1959) and was created by Bob Kane, David Wood and Sheldon Moldoff as "Mr Zero" and was considered a gimmick character. He was later renamed and popularized by the 1960s Batman television series, in which he was played by several actors.</p>
					<p>Nearly 30 years later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. Batman: The Animated Series retold Mr. Freeze\'s origin in "Heart of Ice", an episode by writer Paul Dini. The episode introduced his terminally ill, cryogenically frozen wife Nora, which explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds. This more complex, tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by the Joker. Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.</p>'
